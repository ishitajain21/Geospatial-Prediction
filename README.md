# Geospatial Prediction of Agriculture and Precipitation

This repository contains the code and analysis for the winning project at the 2023 Washington Technology Student Association Conference. The project focused on forecasting the effects of global warming on environmental data across the contiguous United States, with a particular emphasis on precipitation patterns and agricultural output. My peers were Jason Zhao and Kyra Wolff. 

## Overview

The key objectives of this project were:

1. Collect and analyze real-world environmental data from over 8,000 entries across the United States, spanning precipitation, temperature, and agricultural sales.
2. Train an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series model to predict precipitation patterns with high accuracy (85%).
3. Tune and optimize various machine learning models, including XGBoost, Perceptrons, and Bayesian Ridge, with 25 hyperparameters, to predict agricultural output.
4. Showcase the research and findings in a comprehensive paper, presented by a team of three to GIS and Data Science professionals.

## Achievements

- **1st Place** at the 2023 Washington Technology Student Association Conference
- Developed a highly accurate precipitation prediction model using ARIMA
- Optimized machine learning models to forecast agricultural output based on environmental factors
- Conducted extensive data analysis and visualization to uncover patterns and trends
